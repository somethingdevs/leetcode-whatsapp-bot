# LeetCode of the Day WhatsApp Bot ðŸ¤–
## Overview
Welcome to the LeetCode of the Day WhatsApp Bot! If your life revolves around solving daily coding challenges on LeetCode but you're just too chill to check it manually, this bot is for you. Let's spice up your coding journey with some automated spice!

## What It Does
Our glorious bot lives to serve one epic purpose: to notify you via WhatsApp every time a fresh "LeetCode of the Day" drops. Itâ€™s like your personal coding alarm clock that goes, "Wake up babe, new 'LeetCode of the Day' just dropped."

## Features
- Daily Notifications: Automatically sends a message when LeetCode updates its daily challenge.
- 100% Dankness: Incorporates the finest memes in notifications for that extra bit of motivation.
- Fully Automated: Runs on sorcery and a bit of Python (or JavaScript, who knows?), so you don't have to do anything once it's set up.

## Getting Started
